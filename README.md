##Word application
the following assumptions were made during the development:
1) I downloaded a dictionary from the Oracle website and used it for the development: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/examples/dictionary.txt
2) Based on a given string, the first part of my `main` method generates the possible English wordsand saves it to a hashset.
3) I validated the set of the words using the `isEnglishWord` method from the Dictionary class.
